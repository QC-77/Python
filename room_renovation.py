# Room Renovation Material Calculator

# Step 2: Define dimensions of the selected room
# Replace these values with actual measurements
length = 20  # in feet
width = 30   # in feet

# Step 3: Calculate the perimeter of the room
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)  # in feet

# Step 4: Calculate the floor area of the room
area = length * width  # in square feet

# Step 5: Print the amount of floor material required
print(f"Floor material required: {area} square feet")

# Step 6: Print the amount of baseboard material required
print(f"Baseboard material required: {perimeter} feet")
